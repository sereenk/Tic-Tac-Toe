## PROJECTS OVERVIEW:

This is a Tic Tac Toe game between two players. The program will prompt each player for their move and then check to see if anyone has won after each move. If the board fills up and nobody has won, then the program will declare the program as a tie.

## PROGRAM BEHAVIORS:

The program will display a 3X3 game board with numbers 1 through 9 in cells and prompts user for X's move. This will be displayed on the command line.
The program will reject invalid inputs like non-numbers, numbers <1 or >9, and other ambiguous inputs and prompts user for a valid input.
The program rejects moves into occupied spaces and prompts the user for a different move. If the move is valid, the board is displayed with the relevant players' name in the chosen cell. Their name will be displayed for the rest of the game.
The program will be able to determine vertical and horizontal wins.
Finally, the program displays the correct winner - Nobody, X or O.
